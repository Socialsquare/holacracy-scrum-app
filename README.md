# Holacracy Scrum app
This is a placeholding repository for a Holacracy app describing the governance to be adopted when introducing Scrum to your organisation.

At it's minimal form it should introduce the three core Scrum roles with their purpose, domains and accountabilities.

# How to get involved
- Star the repository to remain updated on the progress.
- Create issues on what governance the app is missing.
- Do a fork, start writing and do a pull request.
